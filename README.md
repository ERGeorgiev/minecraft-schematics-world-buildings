# üåç Minecraft Schematics ‚Äì World Structures

A community-driven archive of **Minecraft schematics** representing **real-world structures**.

Whether it's a famous monument, a traditional village house, or a skyscraper, this project aims to collect and preserve accurate, ready-to-paste `.schem` files for builders, educators, and server creators.

## üì¶ What‚Äôs Inside

This repository stores `.schem` (and optionally `.schematic`) files organized by region. Each submission may include:

- A `structure-name.schem` file of the structure in 1:1 scale
- A preview image (`structure-name.png`) of the build

## üß∞ How to Use

You can use the `.schem` files with any of the following:

- [FastAsyncWorldEdit (FAWE)](https://github.com/IntellectualSites/FastAsyncWorldEdit)
- [WorldEdit (1.13+)](https://enginehub.org/worldedit)
- [Litematica](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica)
- [Amulet Editor](https://www.amuletmc.com/)
- [MCStructure Tool (for conversion)](https://github.com/Nixinova/MCStructure)

To load a schematic in-game:

- Download the schematic file
- Put the file in any world edit plugin folder (for example `server/plugins/FastAsyncWorldEdit/schematics`)
- Restart your game or server
- Run the following commands

```
//schem load <filename>
//paste
```
